    - Data must be sorted.

    - if element is greater than , then search left half of the array
    - if the element is less than the value , search the right half of the array
    - similar to Merge Sort,
    - Recursively search
    - At some point, there will be only one element in the partition you are checking, but it doesnt have to get that point
    - O(logn) - keeps dividing the array in half
